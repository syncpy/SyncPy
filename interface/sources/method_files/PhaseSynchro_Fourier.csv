Name,,,PhaseSynchro_Fourier
Description,,,"It computes n:m synchronization index gamma2_nm as the intensity of the first Fourier mode of the cyclic relative phase of two univariate signals x and y
    (in pandas DataFrame format). Gamma2_nm ranges in [0,1] where 0 means no synchronization at all and 1 means perfect synchronization."
